## 4 Things that I did that are not mentioned to improve the app

1. Redesigned the app into a Registration app called "Major Registration Portal". This change was needed because I wanted it to be similar to the code that was given to us.
I changed the design of the login fxml and put a background for it. I also did the same thing for the signup fxml. and coded in the login function of the LoginController to login into the app.

2. Created "About" menu item that gives an overview of this program which lets students register for their major by filling in their information and adding it to the system.
There are also other features like editing, deleting, and clearing information. Some features changes the appearance of the program, import and export data by CSV, and upload profile pictures.
I created it by renaming it from "Help" to "About" and making the text not editable.

3. Created keyboard shortcuts for adding, clearing, deleting, editing, and copying data. This change was needed because this was the first thing that I thought for this task.
I used SceneBuilder to make the menuitem "Keyboard Shortcuts" and set the fx:id to the menuitems, and also have the right functions set with the onActions.
Command + a is add, Command + e is edit, Command + d is delete, Command + r is clear, and Command + c is copy.

4. I changed the title of the primary stage from "FSC CSC311 _ Database Project" to "Major Registration Portal" because the program had to be different from when we first saw it.
I also changed the primary stage's icon into a picture of FSC logo since I want it to be a portal for the college. I changed them both in the start method in the Main Application.
